This is the development repository for an algorithm for finding biologically
meaningful pathways in metabolic networks. The goal is to find pathways in a
graph of metabolic reactions that conserve a given number of carbon atoms from
start to goal. Pathways which conserve a high percentage of atoms from the
start to goal compounds will be biologically relevant. So, by tracking atoms,
we are more likely to find metabolic pathways of biological importance. The
movement of atoms through the pathway's reactions is modeled as the movement of
flow through a directed graph. Applications for this work include metabolic
engineering, as well as more general flow movement problems.
